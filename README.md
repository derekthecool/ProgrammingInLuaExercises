# Programming In Lua - Exercises

This repo is my work following along with the book
[Programming In Lua 4th edition](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html)
This link is to the online version, which is available for free. I have
purchased the paper copy as well to help support the lua project.

First work will be focus on the C API section, starting at [chapter 24](https://www.lua.org/pil/24.html).
Then possibly I may include work on the lua only first portion of the book.

## Build Setup

I've copied the entire lua 5.3 source into this repo. The build system uses
cmake to create the lua library which is used in the C API examples.
